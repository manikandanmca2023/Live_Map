Live_Map

This program showcases a simple web page with a Mapbox map. It initializes a map, places a marker at the first set of coordinates, 
and then animates the marker along a predefined array of coordinates (busStops). The animation is triggered by clicking a button in the map overlay.
 The provided Mapbox access token is essential for using Mapbox services. Overall, the program demonstrates basic map interaction and animation using Mapbox GL.
